# My Fisrt Blog Post 

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro!. I will share my learnings in this post. 

## What I have accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First I created a new Astro project and set up the editor
22. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
